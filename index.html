<!-- 
	** PLAN
		* Display starting point with explanation of the rules (explain what's behind the doors and prompt the user to choose one)
		* Mark the selected door
		* Open another door, change explanation (to let the user know why the other door was opened), mark the opened door (opacity low)
		* Reveal goat behind the door (write "Goat" next to the door number: 1 - Goat
		* Ask the user if he/she wants to select the other remaining door or stay with his/her initial choice
		* Mark selected door again and remove the marking from the fisrt one if the user changes the selection
		(look at active doors, remove selection from them and only select the target of the event)
		* Reveal price with final message + replay button
